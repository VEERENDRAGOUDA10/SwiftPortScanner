- **📡 Service Identification**: Retrieves detailed service banners to discern operational protocols.
- **⚡ Concurrent Execution**: Optimizes efficiency through parallel thread management, expediting scan completion.

### 🖥️ Operational Deployment

Deploy SwiftPortScanner effortlessly:

```sh
python3 swift_port_scanner.py TARGET START_PORT END_PORT THREADS
```

- `TARGET`: Specifies the IP address or hostname of the target system.
- `START_PORT`: Initiates scanning from this port number.
- `END_PORT`: Concludes scanning at this port number.
- `THREADS`: Defines the number of concurrent threads for accelerated scanning.

### 📈 Usage Example

Execute a comprehensive scan from port 1 to 1024 on `192.168.1.1` with 10 threads:

```sh
python3 swift_port_scanner.py 192.168.1.1 1 1024 10
```
